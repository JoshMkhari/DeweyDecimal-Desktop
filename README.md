# Dewey Decimal System Learning Games

This repository contains three interactive games designed to help users learn and reinforce their knowledge of the Dewey Decimal System, which is a widely used library classification system. The games were developed using C# and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework.

## Game 1: Find Call Numbers

**Description:** This game focuses on learning the top-level and mid-level categories of the Dewey Decimal System. Users are presented with a description, and they must select the corresponding call number from a set of options.

**Key Learnings:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Event Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Stacks)
- User Interface (UI) Development with WPF

## Game 2: Replace Books

**Description:** In this game, users practice sorting and organizing call numbers by moving blocks between different stacks. The game has various difficulty levels and allows users to adjust stack sizes and sorting orders.

**Key Learnings:**
- UI Manipulation and Animation
- Game Logic Implementation
- Modular Design
- Error Handling and User Feedback
- XAML Integration

## Game 3: Identifying Areas

**Description:** This game presents users with a basketball court-like interface, where they must aim and shoot basketballs at the correct hexagon targets representing different call number categories or descriptions.

**Key Learnings:**
- Timer and Animation
- Collision Detection
- Random Number Generation
- User Experience and Feedback
- Game Logic and Algorithms

## Overall Learnings

Through the development of these three games, several programming concepts and skills were reinforced, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- User Interface (UI) Development with WPF and XAML
- Event Handling and User Interactions
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Game Logic Implementation
- Modular Design and Code Organization
- Error Handling and User Feedback
- Animation and Visual Effects
- Collision Detection
- Random Number Generation

These games not only provide an interactive and engaging way to learn the Dewey Decimal System but also serve as practical examples of applying various programming concepts and techniques in a real-world application.
